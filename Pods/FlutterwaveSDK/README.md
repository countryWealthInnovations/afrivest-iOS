# FlutterwaveSDK
 
**Flutterwave IOS SDK** allows you to build a quick, simple and excellent payment experience in your iOS app. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details.

## Example
 
 To run the example project, clone the repo, and open `FlutterwaveSDK.xcworkspace` in the Example directory with **Xcode**, run and build and you are good to go!
 
1. If you donâ€™t have an account, sign up for a [Flutterwave account](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/signup).
2. Fill in the following `config details` in the `Viewcontroller.swift` to configure your payment type
 
```
config.paymentOptionsToExclude = []
config.currencyCode = "[NGN,USD,KES,RWF,ZAR,GBP,GHS,ZMF,XAF,XOF, e.t.c ]" // This is the specified currency to charge in.
config.email = "user@flw.com" // This is the email address of the customer
config.isStaging = false // Toggle this for staging and live environment
config.phoneNumber = "077883***1" //Phone number
config.transcationRef = "IOS TEXT" // This is a unique reference, unique to the particular transaction being carried out. It is generated when it is not provided by the merchant for every transaction.
config.firstName = "Yemi" // This is the customers first name.
config.lastName = "Desola" //This is the customers last name.
config.meta = [["metaname":"sdk", "metavalue":"ios"]] //This is used to include additional payment information
config.narration = "simplifying payments for endless possibilities"
config.publicKey = "[PUB_KEY]" //Public key
config.encryptionKey = "[ENCRYPTION_KEY]" //Encryption key
config.isPreAuth = false  // This should be set to true to preauthoize card transactions
let controller = FlutterwavePayViewController()
let nav = UINavigationController(rootViewController: controller)
controller.amount = "[]" // This is the amount to be charged.
controller.delegate = self
self.present(nav, animated: true)
```
 
After this is done, you can make test payments, please ensure `config.isStaging = true`,   toggle to test mode and use the keys gotten when you toggle to test mode on your dashboard. 

*Please note that the test cards will not work with Live API keys, they will only work on the staging environment.*
 
Please go to https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/test-cards for a list of test card numbers.

**Please note that merchant must be PCI-DSS compliant to be able to charge cards on Flutterwave SDK**

print("Successful with \(responseData?.flwRef ?? "Failed to return data")")
 
}
 
func tranasctionFailed(flwRef: String?, responseData: FlutterwaveDataResponse?) {
print( "Failed transaction with FlwRef \(flwRef.orEmpty())")
}
 
let flutterLabel = UILabel()

let underLineView = UIView()
let launchButton = UIButton(type: .system)
 
 
 
@objc func showExample(){
   let config = FlutterwaveConfig.sharedConfig()
   config.paymentOptionsToExclude = []

   config.firstName = "Yemi" // This is the customers first name.
   config.lastName = "Desola" //This is the customers last name.
   config.meta = [["metaname":"sdk", "metavalue":"ios"]] //This is used to include additional payment information
   config.narration = "simplifying payments for endless possibilities"
   config.publicKey = "[PUB_KEY]" //Public key
   config.encryptionKey = "[ENCRYPTION_KEY]" //Encryption key
   config.isPreAuth = false  // This should be set to true for preauthorize card transactions
   let controller = FlutterwavePayViewController()
   let nav = UINavigationController(rootViewController: controller)
